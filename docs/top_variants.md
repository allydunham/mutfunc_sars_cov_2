# Common variants with interesting predicted effects

I have identified all significant predictions above 1% frequency and phosphosites
and interfaces between 0.1% and 1%

* S D614G (0.73) - FoldX predicts desabilising. In S-S interface, not predicted 
                   destabilising but does cause one interface residue to be lost
* NC R203K (0.27) - Significant & high quality SIFT4G score
* NC G204R (0.27) - Significant & high quality SIFT4G score
* ORF3a Q57H (0.23) - FoldX predicts destabilising. In the homodimer interface, not 
                      not destabilising but adds two residues to the interface
* NSP6 L37F (0.12) - Significant SIFT4G score but low quality alignment
* ORF3a G251V (0.08) - Significant SIFT4G score but suboptimal alignment
* NSP2 P585S (0.04) - Significant SIFT4G score but low quality alignment
* NC S194L (0.02) - Phosphosite and significant & high quality SIFT4G score
* NC S197L (0.02) - Phosphosite
* NSP3 A58T (0.02) - Signifiant SIFT4G score but low quality alignment
* ORF3a G196V (0.02) - FoldX predicts very destabilising
* M T175M (0.02)Â - Significant & high quality SIFT4G 
* NC P13L (0.02) - Significant & high quality SIFT4G
* NSP3 T1198K (0.01) - Significant but low quality SIFT4G score and slightly stabilising FoldX prediction
* NSP3 T428I (0.01) - FoldX predicts strongly stabilising and significant but low quality SIFT4G score 
* NC D103Y (0.01) - Significant & high quality SIFT4G score
* NSP7 S25L (0.01) - Significantly destabilising in the interface with NSP8
* NC S202N (0.004) - Phosphosite and significant & high quality SIFT4G score
* NSP8 M129I (0.0025) - In the NSP8 and NSP12 interface
* NC S183Y (0.002) - Phosphosite
* NC T205I (0.002) - Phosphosite
* S T29I (0.0016) - Phosphosite
* ORF3a L108F (0.0015) - Homodimer interface, predicted destabilising
* NC S202C (0.0011) - Phosphosite
* NC S202T (0.001) - Phosphosite
