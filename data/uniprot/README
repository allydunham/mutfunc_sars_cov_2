The files in this directory provide pre-release access to the Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) protein sequences from
the current public health emergency.

The data is provided as it will be published in UniProtKB release 2020_02 of
April 22nd. Please note that this release was prepared before the WHO officially
named the virus "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" and therefore
uses the scientific name that was published by the NCBI taxonomy database at
that time (meanwhile classified as an "equivalent name" at
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=2697049).
